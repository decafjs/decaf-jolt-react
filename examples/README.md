React Example/Demo
==================

This directory contains a fully functional example application that demonstrates React JSX programs served by and
compiled by the decaf-jolt-react ReactServer for Jolt.

To run the example:

```
% bower install
% ./run.sh
```
Then point your browser at http://localhost:9090/

Decaf and Jolt allow you to edit your .jsx files and reload your browser without having a watch program or doing a
command line compile of the .jsx to .js.  To see this in action:

1) Point your browser at http://localhost:9090/hello2.
2) Edit jsx/hello.jsx and change the text in the &lt;h1> tag.
3) Save the file.
4) Reload your brower.

You should see the original "Hello, world!" text change, as your edit dictates.
